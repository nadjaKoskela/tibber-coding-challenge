# tibber-coding-challenge
*** DISCLAIMER ***
Before anything else, I wanted to mention that this has been the first time I have ever worked with React or Node.js, so the setup alone took quite some time. 
As for my JavaScript skills, they are very basic at this point as well, but are increasing, as I'm taking different online courses.
Also - to be perfectly honest - I used Google way more than I intended to, as there were a lot of first times involved in the creation. 
This is certainly reflected in the code and structure as well as my way of working - I did not follow the exact step by step plan below, as I switched a lot between different tasks if I got stuck on either one of them.
These limitations are also the reason that I was not able to follow through with the challenge - I was not able to complete anything related to the GraphQL-API. To at least have some dynamic content on the page, I went with something very simple that changes some small page element.
But it was still pretty fun and I'm sure that I learned quite a lot in a fairly short time :)


HOW TO START THE PAGE
Excellent question - I am not quite sure about this.
I found this source but haven't tried it: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/
Locally, I did it like this: 
    1. Install Node.js on your local computer
    2. Install React.js on your local computer
    3. Download project folder
    4. Open console
    5. Navigate to project folder in console
    6. Start application (npm start)
    7. Page should open in browser - if not, open "http://localhost:3000/" in browser


APPROACH
0. Setting up the environment
    Installing Node-js and React.js, setting up the project with Create React App (via console 'npx create-react-app file-name')
    Time needed: a couple of hours (6h?), as I had no idea what either one of them was or how it worked

Preparation work
    1. Prototyping
        sketching of the page layout for desktop and mobile
        Time needed: a couple of minutes (0,2h)
    2. Page structure
        Breaking the layout down into elements and code blocks
        Noting down of classes for different element
        Time needed: a couple of minutes (0,4h)
    3. Planning of dynamic elements
        Brief sketch of actions and classes
        Time needed: a couple of minutes (0,2h)
Static page
    4.  Setup of static page sections and elements in JSX
        Rough coding of page elements, some still with placeholder classes
        Note: This took longer due to my lack of experience with React - if I had to do it again, it would be much faster
        Time needed: 1,5h   
        Time needed next time: 0,5h
    5.  Styling of elements in CSS
        Setting of attributes - this took quite some back and forth and iterations
        Time needed: 2h
    6.  Mobile styling in CSS
        Adjusting attributes for mobile devices
        Time needed: 0,3h
    7.  Final touches and last check
        Time needed: 0,2h
Dynamic elements
    8.  Research on functions and implementations in React
        Learn about syntax and dynamic content in Research
        Time needed: 2h
    9.  Code functions
        sayHello() and clearInputField()
        Linking of functions to elements
        Fixing some bugs and error messages
        Time needed: 1,2h
    10. Testing of all cases 
        Time needed: a couple of minutes (0,2h)
Finishing up
    11. Documentation & time logging
        Time needed: 1h
    12. Exporting & uploading project
        Included research
        Time needed: 1h
Documentation & time logging
        Time needed: 1,0h

Total time (including setup and research): 16,2h 
Total time (working time only): 7,2h
